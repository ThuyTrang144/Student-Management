## 🎯 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

I've opened GitHub for you. Follow these steps:

### In GitHub (browser):

1. **Repository name:** `student-management` (or your preferred name)
2. **Description:** Student Management System with Supabase
3. **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
4. **DON'T initialize with README** (we already have code)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use THESE instead:

```bash
# Copy your repository URL from GitHub (looks like):
# https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-management.git

# Then run these commands in your terminal:
```

## 🚀 Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once you've created the repository, tell me your GitHub username and I'll help you push the code!

Or run these commands yourself (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-management.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ⏭️ What's Next?

After pushing to GitHub:

1. Go to Vercel.com
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy!
